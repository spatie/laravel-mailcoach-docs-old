This page shows a summary of the statistics for your campaign. At a glance, you can see how many people opened your email and clicked any links you included, and also how many people unsubscribed from your mailing list as a result of this campaign and how often the emails bounced.

A bounce means that an email could not be delivered to a certain email address, this could happen for several reasons. You can better find out why in the [_Outbox_](/docs/v2/app/campaigns/campaign-statistics#outbox) tab.
