title: Tags and segments

Tags and segments are used to divide a subscriber list into parts that can be targeted by an email campaign.

## Tags

Tags describe something about the user the tag is attached to.

Tags only need a name, that should describe what the tag says about a user. For example, a tag's name could be "_bought-product-A_", which would be assigned to subscribers that have bought a certain item in your (web)shop. Users can be assigned multiple tags. Tags by themselves are not used for anything in Mailcoach as long as they are not grouped into a segment.

Tags can be assigned to users manually by clicking their email address in the subscriber list, or automatically when they subscribe through a form, read about this [here](https://mailcoach.app/docs/app/lists/settings#subscriptions).

## Segments

A segment is a group of tags that can be targeted by an email campaign. An example of a segment could be "_bought-any-product_" or when using negative selectors "_have-not-bought-any-product_".

When creating a campaign, you can choose to send it to an entire mailing list, or one of its segments:
