By default, Mailcoach uses a plain textarea field to edit campaigns and templates. If you'd like to use a feature rich editor, you can install one of the add-on packages.

- [Unlayer](/docs/v2/package/customizing-the-editor/unlayer): a drag and drop editor that requires no knowledge of html
- [Monaco](/docs/v2/package/customizing-the-editor/monaco): a powerful code editor that offers syntax highlighting and auto completion.

Other editors can be supported by [writing your own editor class](/docs/v2/package/customizing-the-editor/bring-your-own-editor). If you feel you've created an editor class that can be useful for other, [let us know](mailto:support@mailcoach.app), and we'll consider packaging it, and adding it to our docs.
