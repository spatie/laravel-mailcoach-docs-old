This package contains a beautiful UI that allows you to manage campaigns, email lists and subscribers.

The UI is available on the url you used in the `mailCoach` route macro. If you added `Route::mailcoach('mailcoach');` to your routes the UI will be available on `/mailcoach`.

For more information on the UI, check [the application docs](/docs/v3/app). Note that when using Mailcoach as a package, it won't have auth screens or user management, because it is assume that the application where you install Mailcoach in already has that functionality.
