This package contains a beautiful UI that allows you to manage campaigns, email lists and subscribers.

//TODO: add screenshot

The UI is available on the url you used in the `mailCoach` route macro. If you added `Route::mailCoach('mailcoach');` to your routes the UI will be available on `/mailcoach`.
